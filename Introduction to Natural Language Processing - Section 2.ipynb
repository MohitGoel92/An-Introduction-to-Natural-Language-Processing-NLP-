You look beautiful.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: I think it\\'s bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.\\n[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering]\\n[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer]\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Governor Weatherby Swann, it\\'s been too long.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: His Lord now... actually.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh, is it? That\\'s annoying. My mistake. Arrest her.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: On what charges?\\nWILL TURNER: No!\\n[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail]\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah-ha! Here\\'s the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present?\\nELIZABETH SWANN: *What are the charges?*\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: I don\\'t believe that\\'s the answer to the question I asked.\\nWILL TURNER: Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...\\nELIZABETH SWANN: We are under the jurisdiction of the King\\'s governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. \\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: *Captain* Jack Sparrow.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.\\nScene: BLACK PEARL\\n[views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night] \\n[Gibbs walks the deck alone at night, singing and drinking from a bottle]\\nGIBBS: Fifteen men on a dead man\\'s chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! \\n[a bell tolls, Gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound]\\n[Gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky]\\nScene: TURKISH PRISON\\n[tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island] \\n[pinnacle-like island off the coast at night, connected to the mainland by thin, lighted bridge]\\n[cages with men inside line the bridge]\\n[prisoners are being marched across the bridge]\\n[a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering, and is dragged across the bridge by guards]\\n[a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]\\n[the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like door in the ground, he also screams]\\n[rocky shoreline, lit with torches]\\n[men toss caskets into the sea]\\n[numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen]\\n[a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top] \\n[sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, along with much wood]\\n[hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it at audience for a moment]\\n[Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain\\'s hat on]\\nJACK SPARROW: Sorry, mate.\\n[Jack breaks the skeleton\\'s leg off]\\nJACK SPARROW: Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn\\'t think so.\\n[Jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar, rows toward the full moon and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon]\\nScene: BLACK PEARL\\n[Jack arrives at the Black Pearl in his coffin rowboat]\\n[Gibbs holds out his hand to help Jack aboard, Jack puts the skeleton leg in Gibbs\\' hand]\\n[Cotton drapes a coat onto Jack\\'s back]\\nGIBBS: Not *quite* according to plan.\\nJACK SPARROW: Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.\\nGIBBS: You got what you went in for, then?\\nJACK SPARROW: Mm-hmm!\\nGIBBS: Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it. \\nLEECH: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. \\nMARTY: And the hurricane! Aye.\\nCREW: Aye. Aye.\\nGIBBS: All in all, it\\'s seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.\\nJACK SPARROW: Shiny?\\nGIBBS: Aye, shiny.\\nJACK SPARROW: Is that how you\\'re all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?\\nCOTTON\\'S PARROT: Awk! Walk the plank! \\n[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird]\\nJACK SPARROW: What did the bird say?\\nLEECH: Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. \\n[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]\\nJACK SPARROW: Ohhh!\\n[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]\\n[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it\\'s on the deck]\\n[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging]\\nGIBBS: Know that don\\'t do no good. \\nJACK SPARROW: It does me.\\n[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]\\nMARTY: It\\'s a key!\\nJACK SPARROW: No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key. \\n[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]\\n[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat]\\nJACK SPARROW: Gentlemen, what do keys do?\\nLEECH: Keys... unlock... *things*? \\nGIBBS: And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there\\'s something valuable. So, we\\'re setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!\\nJACK SPARROW: No! If we don\\'t have the key, we can\\'t open whatever it is we don\\'t have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don\\'t have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\\nGIBBS: So - We\\'re going after this key!\\nJACK SPARROW: You\\'re not making any sense at all. Any more questions?\\nMARTY: So... Do we have a heading?\\nJACK SPARROW: Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction. \\nGIBBS: Cap\\'n? \\nJACK SPARROW: Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, oy/quick, oy/quick, hey!\\n[Marty and Gibbs gather alone by the railing]\\nMARTY: Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin\\' a bit strange... -er. \\nGIBBS: Settin\\' sail without knowing his own headin\\'? Somethin\\'s got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.\\n[the Black Pearl is shown at night in a thunderstorm]\\nScene: PORT ROYAL: EITC HEADQUARTERS\\n[a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map]\\n[a guard brings Will in manacles into Beckett\\'s office]\\nGUARD: Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir. \\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Those won\\'t be necessary.\\n[Will\\'s manacles are removed]\\n[Beckett pours some liquor] \\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.\\nWILL TURNER: More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: We\\'ve had dealings in the past. And we\\'ve each left our mark... on the other. \\nWILL TURNER: What mark did he leave on you? \\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.\\nWILL TURNER: Recover. At the point of a sword?\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: *Bargain*!\\n[Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Letters of Marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.\\nWILL TURNER: Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish. Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and your fiancée face the hangman\\'s noose. \\nWILL TURNER: So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: The Black Pearl?\\nWILL TURNER: The property you want that he possesses.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: A ship? Hardly. The item in question\\'s considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times. A compass. Ah, you know it. Bring back that Compass, or there\\'s no deal.\\nScene: BLACK PEARL\\n[Jack is using calipers on a map, using his left hand, a \"P\" brand mark is seen on his right arm]\\n[an hourglass is in the background, Jack taps the Compass]\\n[Jack looks in his bottle, turns the bottle upside-down, only a few drops spill out]\\nJACK SPARROW: Why is the rum always gone?\\n[Jack rises to his feet, staggers]\\n[Jack picks up his hat off the top of a globe]\\nJACK SPARROW: Oh! *That\\'s* why.\\n[Jack walks past the crew sleeping on hammocks, Jack is carrying a lantern]\\n[some of the crew are snoring, and Cotton is among those sleeping]\\nJACK SPARROW: As you were, gents.\\n[Jack goes downstairs to the hold, an animal bleats, Jack unlocks the door, goes in]\\n[Jack sees eerie filter feeder creatures festooning a beam of wood]\\n[Jack spots a rack of bottles, with the bottles stored sideways like in a wine rack]\\nJACK SPARROW: Ah!\\n[Jack pulls a sideways bottle from the rack]\\n[Jack pours sand out of the bottle] \\n[Jack drops bottle of rum in fright, the bottle breaks on the floor]\\n[Jack walks over to see who spoke]\\nJACK SPARROW: Bootstrap. Bill Turner.\\n[Bootstrap looks up from where he\\'s sitting on a barrel, crabs scuttle across his face]\\nJACK SPARROW: Is this a dream?\\nJACK SPARROW: I thought not.

Could he?\\nTIA DALMA: It was not wort\\' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times.\\nWILL TURNER: You knew this.\\nJACK SPARROW: I did not. I didn\\'t know where the key was. But now we do.

Simple, easy to remember.\\nRAGETTI: Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!\\nJACK SPARROW: Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt!

With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?\\nDAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?\\nJACK SPARROW: Yep! I\\'m good with it. Should we seal it in blood?

You look beautiful.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: I think it\\'s bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.\\n[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering]\\n[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer]\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Governor Weatherby Swann, it\\'s been too long.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: His Lord now... actually.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh, is it? That\\'s annoying. My mistake. Arrest her.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: On what charges?\\nWILL TURNER: No!\\n[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail]\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah-ha! Here\\'s the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present?\\nELIZABETH SWANN: *What are the charges?*\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: I don\\'t believe that\\'s the answer to the question I asked.\\nWILL TURNER: Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...\\nELIZABETH SWANN: We are under the jurisdiction of the King\\'s governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. \\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: *Captain* Jack Sparrow.\\nLORD CUTLER BECKETT: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.\\nScene: BLACK PEARL\\n[views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night] \\n[Gibbs walks the deck alone at night, singing and drinking from a bottle]\\nGIBBS: Fifteen men on a dead man\\'s chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! \\n[a bell tolls, Gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound]\\n[Gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky]\\nScene: TURKISH PRISON\\n[tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island] \\n[pinnacle-like island off the coast at night, connected to the mainland by thin, lighted bridge]\\n[cages with men inside line the bridge]\\n[prisoners are being marched across the bridge]\\n[a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering, and is dragged across the bridge by guards]\\n[a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]\\n[the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like door in the ground, he also screams]\\n[rocky shoreline, lit with torches]\\n[men toss caskets into the sea]\\n[numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen]\\n[a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top] \\n[sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, along with much wood]\\n[hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it at audience for a moment]\\n[Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain\\'s hat on]\\nJACK SPARROW: Sorry, mate.\\n[Jack breaks the skeleton\\'s leg off]\\nJACK SPARROW: Mind if we make a little side trip?

What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it. \\nLEECH: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. \\nMARTY: And the hurricane! Aye.\\nCREW: Aye. Aye.\\nGIBBS: All in all, it\\'s seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.\\nJACK SPARROW: Shiny?\\nGIBBS: Aye, shiny.\\nJACK SPARROW: Is that how you\\'re all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?\\nCOTTON\\'S PARROT: Awk! Walk the plank! \\n[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird]\\nJACK SPARROW: What did the bird say?\\nLEECH: Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. \\n[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]\\nJACK SPARROW: Ohhh!\\n[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]\\n[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it\\'s on the deck]\\n[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging]\\nGIBBS: Know that don\\'t do no good. \\nJACK SPARROW: It does me.\\n[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]\\nMARTY: It\\'s a key!\\nJACK SPARROW: No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key. \\n[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]\\n[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat]\\nJACK SPARROW: Gentlemen, what do keys do?\\nLEECH: Keys... unlock... *things*? \\nGIBBS: And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there\\'s something valuable. So, we\\'re setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!\\nJACK SPARROW: No! If we don\\'t have the key, we can\\'t open whatever it is we don\\'t have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don\\'t have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?\\nGIBBS: So - We\\'re going after this key!\\nJACK SPARROW: You\\'re not making any sense at all. Any more questions?\\nMARTY: So... Do we have a heading?\\nJACK SPARROW: Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction. \\nGIBBS: Cap\\'n? \\nJACK SPARROW: Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works.

If you both fancy the dress, you\\'ll just have to share, and wear it one after the other. \\nBURSAR: It\\'s not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted. \\nBELLAMY: Is it now? \\'N\\' you? \\nQUARTERMASTER: The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband, lost at sea. A virgin, too, likely as not. And that bodes ill by all accounts.\\nBURSAR: I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it. \\nQUARTERMASTER: No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! \\nBELLAMY: Enough! Enough! You\\'re a pair of superstitious goats and it\\'s got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find \\'er.

The Kraken!\\n[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other]\\nGIBBS: They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh!

If you believe such things. \\nWILL TURNER: And the key will spare him that?\\nGIBBS: Now that\\'s the very question Jack wants answered.

See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause \\'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.\\nWILL TURNER: What... exactly did he put into the chest?\\nTIA DALMA: Him heart.\\nRAGETTI: Literally, or figuratively?\\nPINTEL: He couldn\\'t li\\'erally put his heart in a chest! Could he?\\nTIA DALMA: It was not wort\\' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times.\\nWILL TURNER: You knew this.\\nJACK SPARROW: I did not. I didn\\'t know where the key was. But now we do.

With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?\\nDAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?\\nJACK SPARROW: Yep! I\\'m good with it. Should we seal it in blood?
